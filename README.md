This project uses https://github.com/devopvoid/webrtc-java to create a java WebRTC server. The server accepts peer connections and connects them to each other.

- It is merely an experiment to to learn to work with webrtc-java
- It is my desire to collaborate with other developers who are learning to use this library. 
- This project is designed from the standpoint of a server, it handles connections and cross-connects peers.
- It's not in my interest to perform any media handling in a desktop application.
- More complex features, and robust error handling are specifically left out of the project to make the basic mechanical processes easy to understand.
- I use Code Ready Studio to edit, manage and build this project
