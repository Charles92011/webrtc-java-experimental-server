This project uses https://github.com/devopvoid/webrtc-java
To create a java WebRTC server
The server accepts connections and will either mirror back the tracks, or connect to connections together.
It is merely an experiment to to learn to work with webrtc-java

To run: Run Main.java, and load wsclient.html into a browser. 
On wsclient.html click start, mirror or connect. Connect will prompt you for the session id of another client, as shown above the local video.
